VIREQ/x ToDo

    General
    -------

- Fix or otherwise resolve compile time warnings.

- Translate comments?

- The man pages need to be updated.

- Create a common 'version.h' file.

- Add an example aliases.lst file.

- Explicitly note authors of changes in whatsnew file instead of just using initials
  or assuming which author it is.

- Detail copyright & license information better in COPYING.

- The INSTALLATION instructions in the README file appear to assume that the programs
  have already been compiled.


    - vimkidx.c
- Error and other messages need to be translated from the german? Or add
  gettxt functionality for multiple languages

- Does the indexing option related to 'files.bbs' actually work?  The comparison
  in the code appears to be to "files.bbx" files...
