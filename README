Short description:
-----------------

	VIREQ/x is a fidonet file request processor according to the
	FSC-0086 SRIF standard.

	VIREQ/x is designed simply to be fast. Anyone who is looking for
	easy setup programs, user data bases or stuff like mouse support
	in a file request processor better should look around for another
	software.

	VIREQ/x supports the wilcards '*' and '?' in file name entries.
	The '*' wildcard may be used multiple times in single request
	name entries.

	The configuration of this software is very simple and should be done
	within 5 minutes - even on larger sites. VIREQ/x can be instructed to
	search the complete paths to file areas recursively itself.

	There is no need for a BBS program or for FILES.BBS files to use
	VIREQ/x.

How to install:
--------------

	1. Create a new directory /usr/bin/vireq/
	2. Extract the whole VIREQ/x archive to this new directory.
	3. Make sure that the user which runs binkd and vireq do have write
	   access to this directory and the files in it. E.g. via:
	        chown -R news.news /usr/bin/vireq
	4. Change the sample vireq.cfg and vireq.pwd to fit your system
	   requirements. The vireq.pwd file is not mandatory (see whatsnew).
	5. Run vimkidx
	6. Change your binkd.cfg as described below.
	7. Done.

	The vimkidx program should run periodically via cron to keep your
	indexes	up to date.

The executables:
---------------

        vimkidx   -> Reads vireq.cfg and builds the needed index files
                     for your system (vifile<x>.idx und vipath.idx)

        vireq     -> The request processor program to be called by the binkd
		     mailer for handling file requests. Change your binkd.cfg
		     as follows

			exec "/usr/bin/vireq/vireq *S" *.req

The main configuration file vireq.cfg:
-------------------------------------

  In detail:

	Defines the log file for VIREQ/x. VIREQ/x will replace %u with the
	content of the TASK environment variable.

         logfile          vireq%u.log

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Name for the logfile for all requested files from your system
	including the whole path. This file is for later processing by a
	download counter program. As before, %u is replaced by TASK
	environment variable.

         dlc-log          dlc%u.log

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Your system name to be used in request responses.

         systemname       Charleston BBS

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Your fidonet address to be used as "from" address is request responses.

         aka              2:246/2098

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	The path to use for temporary files when files from an optional
	CD charger are requested (see "-local" below).

         cdtemp           /tmp/

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	The path to your alias definitions. Can be used multiple times.

         aliaslist        /mnt/hdc5/system/im/aliases.lst

	   In this file you can use the "newest" parameter, which will send
	   the most recent file only.

                NODEDIFF /var/spool/fnet/files/nodediff/NODEDIFF.A* [-newest]

	   If -newest is not used, _ALL_ matching files will be sent.
	   
!	Important change since version 0.10.5(vk):
!	Alias names are case sensitive now! So "NODEDIFF" and "nodediff"
!	are different aliases (magics).

        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Here you can list all path names to build the index for VIREQ/x.
	This command can be used multiple times.

	 include-file	  /path/to/filelist/to/include

         include-path     /filebase1 [-s|-t]

	-s means: Include only subdirectories including a FILES.BBS file.

        -t means: Include all subdirectories.

	Further options for "include-file" and "include-path":

		-cd    -> Include this only if vimkidx is run with the
			  "-force" switch. This saves time, since indices
			  for CDs areas are rarely changed.

		-local -> For those of you using a CD charger.
			  File in those directories will be copied in the
			  "cdtemp" directory during a request process and
			  will be deleted by the mailer after transfer.
			  
			  When "-local" is used in conjuction with "-s"/"-t"
			  or in a "include-path" entry, it is valid for all
			  subdirectires.


The password file vireq.pwd:

        See "whatsnew" file.


Todo-List:
----------

        Send me your suggestions, please...

	Support for request limits or different handling of
	protected/unprotected sessions and listed/unlisted sessions is not
	planned. Who really needs that.
