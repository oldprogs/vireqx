Beta History
============

New in 0.10.2(vk) (20.03.2004):
------------------------------

        - Added routines to check os-environment while compiling - to make
          (vk)-changes only affect to unix/linux-binaries. Behavior of
          Win- and OS/2-versions of vireq/vimkindex  are unchanged.
			    
New in 0.10.1(vk) (15.03.2004):
------------------------------

        - Vimkidx/Linux was unable to create Index-Files for Directories and
	  Files with a beginning uppercase-character. Fixed
	  
	- Vireq/Linux was unable to access Index-Files with a beginning
	  uppercase-character. Fixed
	  
	- Vireq/Linux was converting Filerequests completely to lowercase -
	  so it was unable to find files with uppercase-characters

New in 0.10 (25.09.2001):
-------------------------

        - additional configuration file:

                             VIREQ.PWD

                Location:
                             Homedirectory of VIREQ

                Format:       <Path>             <Password>
                       and/or <Partial path>     <Password>
                       and/or <Filename>         <Password>
                       and/or <Partial Filename> <Password>

                Examples:

                        /mnt  MyPw

                        -> All Files below /mnt  are password protected

                        MYFILE.EXT  MYPW

                        -> MYFILE.EXT is password protected regardless of the
                           path

                        /mnt/dir1  mypw1
                        /mnt/dir2  mypw2

                        -> /mnt/dir1, mnt/dir2 and all subdirectories are 
			   password protected

New in 0.09:
------------

        - added Service-Requests

          How to setup:
                - Add the name of the "file" to your alias-list
                - Specify the command to execute
                - Add parameter "-EXECUTE" to the line

                Example:

                Fekill-Key        i:\vireq\fkk.cmd   -EXECUTE

                Explanation:

                If anyone requests "FEKILL-KEY", the command "fkk.cmd"
                will be executed.

                VIREQ creates a file named VIREQSVC.EXECUTE in its home-
                directory (where vireq.exe resides)
                Only content as of now: the name of the requesting sysop
                as specified in his EMSI-data.

                The file that is sent to the requesting system is named
                VIREQSVC.%TASK%, where %TASK% is replaced by the number
                of your mailertask (environment SET TASK=). This file is
                to be created by the program executed as "Service" in the
                vireq-homedirectory.

        - Added special logfiles for download-counter (dlc%TASK%.LOG)

New in 0.08:
------------

        - VIMKIDX now checks for existance of files listed in FILES.BBS

        - PB2VI now only creates "PFADE.DAT" if Proboard's FILECFG.PRO
          has been found.

        - When no file was found for wildcarded requests, the response mail
          did neither show "Files not found:" nor list the files it searched
          for. Fixed.

        - When an alias contains wildcards, Vireq now sends all matching files
          to the remote. Example:

                the aliaslist contains:

                CHARLES_CDROM   i:\filenets\charles\cd*.rar

                In "i:\filenets\charles" there are 5 matching files, all
                of them will be sent:

                 VIR  begin, VIREQ/2 V0.07
                 VIR  Requester is Andreas Imre, .....
                 VIR  Wanted Files:
                 VIR        CHARLES_CDROM
                 VIR  Files found:
                 VIR        I:\FILENETS\CHARLES\cd_game2.rar      (Alias)
                 VIR        I:\FILENETS\CHARLES\cd_game3.rar      (Alias)
                 VIR        I:\FILENETS\CHARLES\cd_snd1.rar      (Alias)
                 VIR        I:\FILENETS\CHARLES\cd_snd2.rar      (Alias)
                 VIR        I:\FILENETS\CHARLES\cd_snd3.rar      (Alias)

        - New switch "-newest" for use within aliaslists.

          Does almost the same as above, but the aliaslist contains

                 NODEDIFF   i:\im\nodediffs\nodediff.a* -newest

                -> only the newest of all nodediff.a* will be sent,
                   not all as it would be without "-newest"


New in 0.07:
------------

        - PB2VI now ignores empty fileareas

        - VIMKIDX ignores empty lines in "include-path"-files

        - Sys1808 occured when there where no CD-areas


New in 0.06:
------------

        - fixed two ugly bugs in VIMKIDX

        - fixed a bug concerning wildcarded requests

        - keyword "systemname" in VIREQ.CFG:
          Define the name of your system.

        - keyword "cdtemp" in VIREQ.CFG:
          When paths/include-files are defined with "-local", requested
          files will be copied into the cdtemp-directory (and deleted
          by the mailer after the request).
          Should only be used with cdrom-changers since any cdrom is fast
          enough to honour requests.

        - support for CD-Areas. When "-cd" is specified behind a path/include-
          file, its index is only updated when VIMKIDX is called with
          parameter "-force". The index-files for the CD-Areas are called
          *.IDC instead of *.IDX.


New in 0.05:
------------

        - keyword "aka" in VIREQ.CFG:
          Specify the aka the request-response will originate from.

        - keyword "dlc-log" in VIREQ.CFG:
          The name of the logfile to be used by vidlc.exe (the program
          to update your download-counters, not finished yet).

        - support of environment-settings in all path- and file-definitions
          (the new $[...] as well as the old %...%-method) except of
          "include-path" defined with -s or -t

New in 0.04:
------------

        - added missing TOPT/FMPT/INTL-Kludges in Netmail-Reply

        - fixed finding non-existent files when a longer name matches
          (e.g.: requesting FECV returns "ok", even though only FECV156.RAR
           exists).
