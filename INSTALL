How to build VIREQ/X
====================

CMake is now the standard build system for VIREQ/X; see the 'Legacy Makefile'
section for information about an alternate way of doing the build and install.
Note that with the current version, installation of all files except for the
man pages is to /opt/vireqx.


(1) Create a build directory for CMake to work in.

    mkdir <vireqx build directory>
    cd <vireqx build directory>


(2) Run CMake to configure and create the build system files.

    cmake [OPTIONS] <vireqx source directory>
    -- OR --
    ccmake <vireqx source directory>
    -- OR --
    cmake-gui <vireqx source directory>


(3) On systems where Makefiles are used, then run:
    make
    sudo make install


For more details on the options available as well as other information, see the
CMake documentation.


Once it is installed, see /opt/vireqx/README (oder f√ºr die Version in Deutsch:
/opt/vireqx/vireq.dok) for more information about the configuration and use
of VIREQ/X.


Legacy Makefile
===============
Note that if you do not have CMake available to you or do not wish to use it,
see below for a copy of an example Makefile for VIREQ/X; you can extract it to
the VIREQ/X source directory and use that instead.

# Legacey Makefile for VIREQ/x

CFLAGS+=-Wall

vireq vimkidx: vimkidx.c vireq.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o vireq vireq.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o vimkidx vimkidx.c

clean:
	rm -f vireq vimkidx
